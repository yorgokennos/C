  Assignment description: Using a generate function (which XORs fixed tap bits
    together to determine the next bit after shifting) along with a starting Key
    to go through each pixel of an input image XOR-ing the RGB components of each 
    pixel to "encode" the image. 
    
    We can decode the image using the encoded image along with our original key
